# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
The objective of this Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a person’s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
Prerequisites:
The requirement for this Python project is a web cam through which we will capture
images. You need to have Python (3.6 version recommended) installed on your system,
then using pip, you can install the necessary packages.
1. OpenCV – pip install opencv-python (face and eye detection).
2. TensorFlow – pip install TensorFlow (Keras uses TensorFlow as backend).
3. Keras – pip install Keras (to build our classification model).
4. Pygame – pip install pygame (to play alarm sound).
